            <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum situated right on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra,
                Uttar Pradesh. It is listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the World due to its exceptional
                architectural beauty. This monument is designed with a blend of Persian, Ottoman, Turkish, and Indian
                architectural styles. Moreover, the intricate carvings, floral motifs, and precious gemstones adorned
                its structure, making it even more attractive.

                Apart from its architectural beauty, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage. This place features
                beautiful lush gardens, a reflective pool, and a mosque, creating a serene and captivating atmosphere.
                The striking symmetry and ever-changing hues of the marble based on the time of day of the Taj Mahal
                make it even more attractive. This reflects India's rich history and cultural heritage, attracting
                millions of tourists every year.</p>

            <h3>Red Fort (Lal Quila)</h3>
            <img src="https://hblimg.mmtcdn.com/content/hubble/img/delhi/mmt/activities/m_activities_delhi_red_fort_3_l_401_1002.jpg" alt="Red Fort" width="350" height="200" aria-placeholder="Lal Quila">
            <p>A significant landmark in <a href="https://www.makemytrip.com/tripideas/">Delhi</a> , the Red Fort or Lal Qila is a splendid monument from the
                Mughal period. It serves as a testament to the country's rich cultural heritage and architectural
                finesse. The striking red sandstone walls coupled with delicate carvings make for a breathtaking sight.


                The fort houses several significant structures that are worth exploring. The Diwan-i-Aam, or the Hall of
                Public Audience, is a vast courtyard where the emperor addressed the general public. The Diwan-i-Khas,
                or the Hall of Private Audience, is known for its stunning marble throne where the emperor held private
                meetings. The Rang Mahal, or the Palace of Colours, was the residence of the royal ladies and features
                beautiful decorative motifs.</p>
